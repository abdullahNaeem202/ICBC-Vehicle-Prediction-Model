# ICBC Vehicle-Prediction 

By exploring vehicle population data published by ICBC on Tableau Public, we developed a pipeline that involved data cleaning, data visualization, and data analysis to predict vehicle type. 

## Relevancy and Business Problem Addressed 

**Question**: "What vehicle characteristics (e.g., Make, Model Year, Body Style, Anti Theft Device Indicator) most strongly predict whether a vehicle is electric?" 

**Relevancy**: 

<p> ICBC is always evaluating risk models for insurance and sustainability adaptation. </p>

<p> By identifying which vehicle characteristics (such as Make, Model Year, Body Style, and Anti-Theft Device Indicator) are strong predictors of electric vehicle ownership, ICBC can enhance its actuarial/prediction models for risk evaluation and premium pricing. </p>

<p> The insights we developed also support long-term sustainability efforts that ICBC can adopt based on forecasting EV adoption trends across different regions, enabling ICBC to align with provincial climate initiatives and inform targeted incentive programs. </p>

<p>Additionally, our analysis helps in resource allocation for claims processing and vehicle servicing, particularly in adapting to the unique repair and operational process/needs of EVs. These findings can also be used to simulate future adoption scenarios, aiding ICBC in strategic forecasting, regulatory planning, and data-driven policy development in the future.</p>


## Dependency 

OS: Windows (For PowerBI compatibility) 

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
